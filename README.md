# Persian-sign-language-HMM
Persian sign language recognition using hidden Markov models (HMMs)
This is a demo code for Persian sign language recognition using hidden Markov models (HMMs). These codes implement the methodology used in [1] for a set of 8 signs as examples.

Note: To run these codes, you need to first download Kevin Murphy’s HMM toolbox from the link below:
https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html

This demo contains two sub-folders. The first one, “1- trj extraction”, contains a sample video of the dataset and the codes to extract the trajectories. The second one, “2- sign classification” contains the normalized trajectories of 8 sample signs and the codes to classify them.
